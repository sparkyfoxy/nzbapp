nzbapp

This is a project for building a Turnkey Linux patch to configure a
Turnkey Linux installation of Ubuntu 10.04 (initially) along with the following additions:

- SABnzbd
- CouchPotato (for locating NZB files for movies)
- Sickbeard (for locating NZB files for TV shows)
- Headphones (for locating NZB files for music releases)
- Maraschino as a front end



NOTES
==================================================================
nzbapp is configured as follows:
- complete and incomplete dinaries are being placed in /srv/storage
  if additional space is needed, it may be best to either create
  an LVM at initial installtion time OR add a second disk to the 
  installation, create a filesystem and mount it on /srv/storage
- You must run through the SABnzbd setup wizard at:
      http://<ipaddress>:8080


DONATIONS
==================================================================
If you want to send donations to keep this work going, please send them to
the authors of the included programs and/or Turnkey Linux.
They are the heroes in this effort, not me.


USAGE
==================================================================
This patch should be applied onto version 11.2 or version 11.3
of the Turnkey fileserver distribution found at:
